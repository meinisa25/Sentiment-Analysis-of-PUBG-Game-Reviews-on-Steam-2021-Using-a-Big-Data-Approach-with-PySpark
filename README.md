# **Sentiment Analysis of PUBG Game Reviews on Steam (2021) Using a Big Data Approach with PySpark**

---

## ðŸ“± **About the Project**

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of user reviews of *PlayerUnknownâ€™s Battlegrounds (PUBG)* on the Steam platform in 2021. With the rapid growth of the gaming industry, Steam has become the worldâ€™s largest digital game distributor with more than 67 million active monthly players and over 7,600 accessible games.  

User reviews serve as a valuable source of information to understand player perceptions of game quality. Sentiment analysis is used in this project to classify reviews into **positive, negative, and neutral categories**.

## ðŸ“‚ Methodology

### a. Data Collection and Preparation
The dataset of PUBG reviews was downloaded from the Steam platform (2021).  
- **Size**: 40,848,659 rows and 23 columns.  
- **Content**: Includes information such as `app_id`, `app_name`, user reviews (`review`), review creation time, user recommendations (`recommended`), and user profile details.  
- The dataset represents a large volume of user feedback, offering a rich source for sentiment analysis.  

The dataset was then loaded into the **PySpark environment** for efficient large-scale processing. Data exploration was conducted to understand structure, features, and sentiment distribution. Data cleaning was also applied, including duplicate removal, handling missing values, and data validation.

### b. PySpark Implementation
PySpark, part of **Apache Spark**, was used for distributed data processing.  
- Operations for manipulation and aggregation.  
- This allowed scalable analysis while maintaining processing efficiency.  

### c. Text Preprocessing
To prepare raw reviews for sentiment analysis:  
1. Tokenization into individual words.  
2. Conversion to lowercase.  
3. Removal of punctuation and special characters.  
4. Stopword removal to reduce noise.  
5. Lemmatization/stemming for consistent word forms.  

### d. Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment labeling was performed using **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner)**, which assigns sentiment scores and categorizes reviews into:  
- Positive  
- Neutral  
- Negative  

### e. Model Training
- The dataset was split into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets.  
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency)** was applied to convert text into numerical feature vectors.  
- Two models were trained for sentiment classification:  
  - **Naive Bayes**  
  - **Logistic Regression**  

### f. Model Performance Evaluation
Evaluation was conducted using multiple metrics:  
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  

Additionally:  
- **Confusion matrices** were generated for both training and testing sets.  
- **Cross-validation** was applied to ensure consistent model performance and prevent overfitting.  

### g. Model Comparison
The performances of **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression** were compared using the evaluation metrics.  
- **Result**: Logistic Regression outperformed Naive Bayes, achieving higher accuracy (94% vs 75%) and proving more suitable for sentiment classification in this context.  
- The best-performing model (Logistic Regression) was selected for final sentiment prediction on PUBG reviews.
